/** @defgroup EXAMPLES_PERIPH_15XX_SPIPOLL LPC15xx SPI bus master (polling) example
 * @ingroup EXAMPLES_PERIPH_15XX
 * <b>Example description</b><br>
 * This example shows how to configure SPI as a bus master in polling mode.<br>
 *
 * This example transmits an array of uint16_t values (0x1111, 0x2222, 0x3333, 0x4444) as SPI master
 * using polling mode. The SPI is configured to be in loop back mode and the received data is compared
 * against the transmitted data, if they match the transmission is repeated and the LED 0 keeps flickering
 * In case of any error or mismatch in received and transmitted data, LED 0 will stay On.<br>
 *
 * <b>Special connection requirements</b><br>
 * There are no special connection requirements for this example.<br>
