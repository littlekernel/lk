/** @defgroup EXAMPLES_PERIPH_15XX_I2CPOLL LPC15xx I2C bus master (polling) example using the ROM API
 * @ingroup EXAMPLES_PERIPH_15XX
 * <b>Example description</b><br>
 * This example shows how to configure I2C as a bus master in polling mode using
 * the ROM-based APIs.<br>
 *
 * This demo supports both 7-bit and 10-bit addressing, but only 7-bit addressing is
 * used in the example. After I2C is setup, the I2C master receive and transmit
 * functions are called through the built-in ROM routines.
 *
 * For the LPCXpresso Motor Control Board rev B, this example reads the LM75A temperature sensor on the
 * base board. Using the debugger or an I2C analyzer, the temperature reading process is visible.
 * The temperature data is also outputted through the Debug UART port.<br>
 *
 * <b>Special connection requirements</b><br>
 * There are no special connection requirements for this example.<br>
