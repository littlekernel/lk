 * @ingroup EXAMPLES_PERIPH_15XX
 * <b>Example description</b><br>
 * The IAP example demonstrates programming a FLASH block during run-time. For this
 * example, the code is running from FLASH and a FLASH block not used for the
 * executing code will be erased and programmed with some data. The example also
 * toggles the LED in the systick interrupt. The interrupts need to be disabled
 * during the IAP calls that change FLASH data and re-enabled after the calls are
 * complete.>br>
 *
 * Do not run this example too many times or set it up to repeatedly erase and
 * reprogram FLASH as it will wear out FLASH.<br>
 *
 * <b>Special connection requirements</b><br>
 * There are no special connection requirements for this example.<br>
