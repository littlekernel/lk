 * <b>Example description</b><br>
 * This example shows how to setup and use the RTC and to use the alarm
 * to wake up the device from a sleep mode.<br>
 *
 * The board LED will toggle on and off twice at a varying rate based on
 * varied (changing) wakeup timing. Then the chip will go to sleep. After 4
 * seconds, the RTC alarm will wakeup the chip and turn on the LED. If you
 * hook up the serial port to a terminal, you will get messages indicating
 * what is happening.<br>
 *
 * <b>Special connection requirements</b><br>
 * There are no special connection requirements for this example.<br>
