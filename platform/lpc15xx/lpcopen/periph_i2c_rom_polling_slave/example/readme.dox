/** @defgroup EXAMPLES_PERIPH_15XX_I2CSLAVEPOLL LPC15xx I2C bus slave (polling) example using the ROM API
 * @ingroup EXAMPLES_PERIPH_15XX
 * <b>Example description</b><br>
 * This example shows how to configure I2C as a bus slave in polling mode using
 * the ROM-based APIs.<br>
 *
 * This demo supports both 7-bit and 10-bit addressing, but only 7-bit addressing is
 * used in the example. After I2C is setup, the I2C receive and transmit functions
 * are called through the built-in ROM routines.<br>
 *
 * If this demo is running correctly and is correctly connected to a master that
 * supports this example, the LED will toggle. Because of the connection
 * requirements, this example is best used as a reference on how to use the ROM
 * API I2C slave functions.<br>
 *
 * <b>Special connection requirements</b><br>
 * IMOPRTANT NOTE:<br>
 * This example requires a connection via I2C to a I2C master. The I2C master writes a byte
 * to the slave which controls the slave's LED state (0 or 1). The master can also read the
 * slave's LED state (0 or 1).<br>
